# Taxonomy Access Control

This module allows you to set access permissions for various taxonomy 
categories based on user role.

There are permissions to `view`, `update`, and `delete` nodes in each category.
Additionally, the `add tag` permission control whether the user can add a 
taxonomy term to a node, and the `view tag` permission controls whether the user
can see the taxonomy term listed on the node.

### IMPORTANT NOTES: 

 - This is a complicated module. When you first learn to use this module, 
   always try it first on a test site.
 - If you want to use two or more access-related modules at the same time,
   test them carefully as they can conflict.
